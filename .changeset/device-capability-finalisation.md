P4 — device-capability architecture complete. All in-tree migration finished; deprecated shims removed.

**Breaking changes in `@podkit/core`:** The following symbols have been removed from the public API: `createIpodCapabilities`, `LibgpodDeviceInfo`, `DEVICE_PRESETS`, `DevicePreset`, `getDevicePreset`, and `resolveDeviceCapabilities`. Callers must migrate before upgrading.

Migration guide:
- `createIpodCapabilities(libgpodInfo)` → `resolveCapabilities(identity)` (preferred, identity-driven) or `resolveIpodModelCapabilities(modelFromLibgpodInfo(libgpodInfo))` for callers that genuinely hold libgpod data.
- `getDevicePreset(deviceType)` → `BUILT_IN_PRESETS[deviceType]` from `@podkit/devices-mass-storage`.
- `DEVICE_PRESETS` → `BUILT_IN_PRESETS` from `@podkit/devices-mass-storage`.
- `resolveDeviceCapabilities(type, overrides)` → `resolveCapabilities(identity, { overrides })` from `@podkit/core`.
- The `core/device/sysinfo-extended` shim path is gone; import `readSysInfoExtended`, `writeSysInfoExtended`, and `ensureSysInfoExtended` from `@podkit/ipod-firmware` directly.

See ADR-295.07 for the full architectural rationale.

**New in `@podkit/ipod-firmware`:** SysInfoExtended file I/O is now owned by this package: `readSysInfoExtended`, `writeSysInfoExtended`, `ensureSysInfoExtended`, `SYSINFO_EXTENDED_PATH`, `SYSINFO_DEVICE_DIR`. Diagnostic helpers `compareSysInfoConsistency` and `normaliseFireWireGuid` are also exported. `ParsedFirmware` gains the optional `modelNumber` field (populated from the `ModelNumStr` plist key when present).

**New in `@podkit/device-types`:** `IpodModel`, `IpodChecksumType`, `IpodGenerationId`, `IpodGenerationIdLike`, `IpodModelSource`, and `IPOD_GENERATION_IDS` are now exported from this package (canonical home). `UsbConnectionInfo` has been removed — use `UsbFingerprint` instead. `IpodIdentity.notSupportedReason` is added for devices identified as iPods that podkit cannot fully support (e.g. iOS-mode devices). `DeviceCapabilities.artworkMaxResolution` is now `number | null` (null when the generation has no known limit or artwork is unsupported).

**In `@podkit/devices-ipod`:** `IpodGeneration.supported` and `IpodGeneration.artworkMaxResolution: number | null` are new fields on every generation entry. `lookupByFamilyId` and `FAMILY_ID_TO_GENERATION` are now exported. `unsupported.ts` is populated with comprehensive Apple iOS device PIDs to allow early rejection of phones and tablets at the USB identification stage.

No user-facing CLI behaviour changes. `podkit device scan`, `podkit device info`, and all sync paths behave identically to P3.
