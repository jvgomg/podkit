# podkit

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [`e47456a`](https://github.com/jvgomg/podkit/commit/e47456a635e7890c90266c6f37c3618c81ba001f) Thanks [@jvgomg](https://github.com/jvgomg)! - Add compilation album support to sync pipeline and CLI display. Compilation metadata from source files (FLAC, MP3, M4A) and Subsonic servers is now correctly written to the iPod database, ensuring compilation albums appear under "Compilations" on the iPod. The `device music` and `collection music` commands show compilation counts in stats, mark compilation albums in `--albums` view, and support a `compilation` field for `--fields`.

- [`2912138`](https://github.com/jvgomg/podkit/commit/29121384f1dc96a9736ae29d9045b746df3dd27d) Thanks [@jvgomg](https://github.com/jvgomg)! - Detect quality preset changes and re-transcode existing tracks. When you change your audio or video quality preset (e.g., `low` to `high`), podkit now detects that existing transcoded content doesn't match the new target bitrate and re-transcodes it on the next sync. Both upgrade and downgrade directions are supported.

  Audio preset changes appear as `preset-upgrade` or `preset-downgrade` in the sync plan, preserving play counts, star ratings, and playlist membership. Video preset changes remove and re-add the video at the new quality. Use `--skip-upgrades` to suppress audio preset re-transcoding.

  Fix inverted `aac_at` encoder quality mapping on macOS — the AudioToolbox AAC encoder uses a 0-14 scale where 0 is highest quality, but the code mapped it backwards. This caused VBR presets to encode at the wrong quality level (e.g., "high" produced ~44 kbps instead of ~256 kbps). Now uses empirically-measured bitrate-to-quality mapping.

  Fix video transcoding storing source file bitrate instead of transcoded output bitrate in the iPod database, which is needed for video preset change detection.

- [`e4485a1`](https://github.com/jvgomg/podkit/commit/e4485a1c1884a3893f58141d2044e6b16c108789) Thanks [@jvgomg](https://github.com/jvgomg)! - Add self-healing sync for changed and upgraded source files. Sync now detects when a source file has improved — format upgrade (MP3 replaced with FLAC), quality upgrade (higher bitrate), artwork added, Sound Check values changed, or metadata corrected — and upgrades the iPod track in place, preserving play counts, star ratings, and playlist membership.

  Upgrades happen by default as part of normal sync. Use `--skip-upgrades` or the `skipUpgrades` config option to disable file-replacement upgrades when short on time or space. The `skipUpgrades` setting follows the standard resolution order (CLI flag → device config → global config → default).

  Add `replaceTrackFile()` to `@podkit/libgpod-node` for replacing a track's audio file while preserving the database entry. The old file is deleted and libgpod generates a fresh path with the correct extension for the new format, ensuring the iPod firmware uses the right decoder.

  Add `hasArtwork` field to `CollectionTrack` — populated by the directory adapter (from embedded pictures) and Subsonic adapter (from cover art metadata).

  Fix copied tracks (MP3, M4A) not having their bitrate recorded in the iPod database, which is needed for quality-upgrade detection.

  **Breaking:** `ConflictTrack` type and `SyncDiff.conflicts` array removed from `@podkit/core` — metadata conflicts are now handled as `metadata-correction` upgrades.

- [`d40371f`](https://github.com/jvgomg/podkit/commit/d40371f876bc9008641b08f26c0087e137cfc871) Thanks [@jvgomg](https://github.com/jvgomg)! - Add Sound Check (volume normalization) support. podkit now reads ReplayGain and iTunNORM tags from source files and writes the Sound Check value to the iPod database during sync, enabling automatic volume normalization on playback. The dry-run output shows how many tracks have normalization data, and a new `soundcheck` field is available in `device music` and `collection music` commands via `--fields`.

- [`4c683ab`](https://github.com/jvgomg/podkit/commit/4c683abe203c56ae09030f04d8089df53a40cf6a) Thanks [@jvgomg](https://github.com/jvgomg)! - Add Sound Check source tracking, tips pattern, and verbose mode enhancements. Sound Check stats now show percentage format (e.g., "620 (95%)"). When coverage is partial, a tip nudges users to add normalization tags. Verbose mode (`-v`) shows adapter source info and a breakdown of Sound Check tag formats (iTunNORM, ReplayGain track/album). Adapters now expose `adapterType` and `soundcheckSource` for richer diagnostics.

### Patch Changes

- [`41ebcde`](https://github.com/jvgomg/podkit/commit/41ebcde52d40864bc13b7e1cf08b55bae2c99c6c) Thanks [@jvgomg](https://github.com/jvgomg)! - Improve Sound Check support: extract ReplayGain data from Subsonic/Navidrome servers via the OpenSubsonic API, show Sound Check coverage in the stats summary for `device music` and `collection music`, and error when `--fields` is used without `--tracks`.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [`d3b8eb2`](https://github.com/jvgomg/podkit/commit/d3b8eb25fc2f453689a5d2e38eb6acb9fe70b1e1) Thanks [@jvgomg](https://github.com/jvgomg)! - Improve `podkit device add` to detect and handle unmounted iPods, including iFlash-modified devices that macOS refuses to automount.
  - Scans for both mounted and unmounted iPods — no longer requires the device to be pre-mounted
  - Assesses unmounted devices before attempting to mount: reads block size and capacity from diskutil, queries USB product ID via system_profiler, and resolves it to a model name (e.g. "iPod Classic 6th generation")
  - Confirms iFlash adapters via two independent signals: 2048-byte block size (iFlash emulates optical media sectors) and capacity exceeding the original iPod Classic maximum of 160 GB
  - Attempts `diskutil mount` first (no elevated privileges required); falls back to `mount -t msdos` for large FAT32 volumes that macOS refuses to mount through its normal mechanisms
  - When sudo is required, explains exactly why with per-signal detail and shows the exact command to run (`sudo podkit device add <name>`)
  - Exports `DeviceAssessment`, `IFlashAssessment`, `IFlashEvidence`, and `UsbDeviceInfo` types from `@podkit/core`

  - Detect unsupported devices (iPod Touch, iPhone, iPad, buttonless Shuffles, Nano 6th gen) with clear error messages explaining why they won't work
  - Warn when iPod model cannot be identified, with instructions to fix SysInfo
  - Show device capability indicators (+/-) in `podkit device info` output

  - `device music`, `device video`, `collection music`, and `collection video` now show summary stats by default (track/album/artist counts and file type breakdown)
  - Add `--tracks` flag to list all tracks (previous default behavior)
  - Add `--albums` flag to list albums with track counts
  - Add `--artists` flag to list artists with album/track counts
  - `--tracks --json` on device commands now includes all iPod metadata fields (play stats, timestamps, video fields, etc.)
