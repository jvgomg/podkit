## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [`d3b8eb2`](https://github.com/jvgomg/podkit/commit/d3b8eb25fc2f453689a5d2e38eb6acb9fe70b1e1) Thanks [@jvgomg](https://github.com/jvgomg)! - Improve `podkit device add` to detect and handle unmounted iPods, including iFlash-modified devices that macOS refuses to automount.
  - Scans for both mounted and unmounted iPods — no longer requires the device to be pre-mounted
  - Assesses unmounted devices before attempting to mount: reads block size and capacity from diskutil, queries USB product ID via system_profiler, and resolves it to a model name (e.g. "iPod Classic 6th generation")
  - Confirms iFlash adapters via two independent signals: 2048-byte block size (iFlash emulates optical media sectors) and capacity exceeding the original iPod Classic maximum of 160 GB
  - Attempts `diskutil mount` first (no elevated privileges required); falls back to `mount -t msdos` for large FAT32 volumes that macOS refuses to mount through its normal mechanisms
  - When sudo is required, explains exactly why with per-signal detail and shows the exact command to run (`sudo podkit device add <name>`)
  - Exports `DeviceAssessment`, `IFlashAssessment`, `IFlashEvidence`, and `UsbDeviceInfo` types from `@podkit/core`
